In this tutorial, we are going to learn about four keywords. Two of them, we have already covered in the previous tutorial, and the other two are new to us. So, letâ€™s get to our actual topic. We are going to learn about try, except, else and finally. We are already familiar with try and expect, but for the sake of revision, we will briefly go through them one more time. 

try and except block:
In the try block, we write the code in which an exception might occur, and in except block, we write the code as a resultant if an exception occurs. This could either be a print statement or the error itself. If no exception occurs, the except block will not execute. The purpose of try and except is to keep the program running either an error or exception occurs. In simple programs, if an error occurs, the program stops its execution and displays the error onto the screen. By using try an except we can show the error as a string onto the screen and the program could continue its execution after that. For further explanation, you can give Tutorial #24 a watch or read the description given below.
